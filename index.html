            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Michel, a computer scientist and technology enthusiast. At 22, I'm a student with a passion for learning and personal growth. I've gained valuable experience working in technology retail, assisting customers, and exploring the vast realm of knowledge. I'm driven by curiosity and innovation, and I aspire to uncover the truth in all aspects of life.

            I appreciate constructive criticism as it helps me learn and evolve. My journey has only just begun, and my current aspiration is to innovate and develop new technologies for the benefit of future generations. I hope to educate and inspire younger generations eager to explore the vast realm of knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Throughout my journey in technology, I have developed a diverse set of skills. I have created numerous video games, explored audio production, music composition, animations, and video editing. I've also ventured into web development and gained proficiency in a wide array of programming languages, such as C#, C++, Python, Java, Node.js, SQL, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            One of my proudest achievements is the development of Xindex, a virtual assistant I created for a school project. Xindex can identify physical objects and serves a variety of purposes, from aiding the visually impaired to providing weather updates. It demonstrates the potential of technology to address diverse and meaningful challenges.</p>
