                <p class="about-text">I am Michel, a 22-year-old who pursued my technology studies at Arlandagymnasiet in Sweden from 2018 to 2022. Currently, I am continuing my education in the field of computer science, while actively seeking job opportunities to gain valuable real-world experience from seasoned professionals.

                    My interests encompass a range of activities, including my passion for dogs, a penchant for writing, a love for video games, and a habit of avidly reading articles. Moreover, I possess a deep curiosity about the intricate workings and governance of the world, a curiosity that has been a part of me since childhood.
                    
                    My journey thus far has been an exciting one, encompassing my educational path, a passion for basketball, involvement in semi-pro esports, a role as staff at a tech shop in Sweden, experience as an esports organization manager, my university journey, the launch of my own organization, and now, my pursuit of job opportunities alongside my academic commitments due to the ample free time in my schedule. NOTE(I dont take pictures this is the best one I had on my pc:) <p>
